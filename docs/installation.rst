Installation
------------

Django-QA aims at keeping things simple. To install it you have to do what you would do with most django apps.

Install with pip::

    pip install django-qa

Add qa and its requirements to INSTALLED_APPS in your project settings:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'qa',
    'taggit',
    'hitcount',
    'django_markdown',
    ...
    )

Add the package urls to the project:

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns = [
        ...,
        url(r'^', include('qa.urls')),
        ...
    ]

Run migrations::

    python manage.py migrate

And that's it!
